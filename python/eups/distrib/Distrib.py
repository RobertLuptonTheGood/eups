class Distrib(object):
    """A class to encapsulate product distribution

    This class is an abstract base class with some default implementation.
    Subclasses will provide an implementation for specific ways to install
    packages or create distributable packages that can be installed by others.  
    A DistribServer instance, passed in via the constructor, controls how a 
    user pulls packages and related information from a distribution server.  
    A Distrib class understands how to unpack and/or build a package and 
    install into the user's software stack; this may include assumptions of 
    conventions of where to put things (though usually that information is 
    brought down from the server).  A Distrib class also understands how to 
    create a server that provides these packages to users: it understands not
    only how to create the necessary files but also how to organize them on 
    the server.  

    An instance of implemented Distrib class is usually accomplished via a 
    DistribFactory, using either createDistrib() (when installing a package) 
    or createDistribByName() (when creating a package).  During package 
    installation, the Distrib class pulls down distribution files from a 
    (usually remote) server using a DistribServer instance (provided when 
    creating the DistribFactory instance).  With package creation, the 
    Distrib class creates the distribution files based on a locally installed 
    version and deploys them into a *local* server directory tree.  Thus a 
    Distrib class can (in principle) be used to replicate an entire server 
    locally.  By using different Distrib class on installation and creation, 
    one can convert a server from one convention to another.  Similarly, one
    can create a distribution of server with a mix of distribution types to,
    for example, provide both generic, build-from-source packages and 
    flavor-spcific, binary alternatives.

    Sub-class implementations must override the value of the static string 
    variable, NAME, which is used as its default name (for look-ups via 
    DistribFactory.createDistribByName()).  They should also provide 
    implementations (at a minimum) for the following unimplemented functions:
       createPackage()
       packageCreated()
       getDistIdForPackage()
       installPackage()
       getTaggedRelease()
       writeTaggedRelease()
       createDependencies()
       updateDependencies()
       writeManifest()

    The DefaultDistrib subclass provides default implementations for the 
    last four functions.

    OPTIONS:
    The behavior of a Distrib class is fine-tuned via options (a dictionary
    of named values) that are passed in at construction time.  This base
    implementation supports a core set; sub-classes usually support them as 
    well but are not required to.  A sub-class may support additional options
    as well.  The core set supported here are:
       noeups           do not use the local EUPS database for information  
                          while creating packages.       
       obeyGroups       If true, then any newly written directory or files 
                          will be set to groupWritable.
       groupowner       when obeyGroups is true, change the group owner of 
                          to this value
       buildDir         a directory that may be used to build a package 
                          during install.  If this is a relative path, it 
                          the full path (by default) will be relative to 
                          the product root for the installation.  (See
                          getBuildDirFor()).
