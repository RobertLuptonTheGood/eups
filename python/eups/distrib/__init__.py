This module is responsible for downloading and installing products from
a distribution server as well as for maintaining packages on that server.
All remote interactions with a server is done via the eups.server module.

The important classes are:
  Distribution     This provides the EUPS application level interface to
                     server-related functions
  Distrib          This provides an abstract API for different techniques
                     for installing products.
  DistribFactory   A factory class for creating Distrib instances that
                     can operate on a given product distribution (i.e.
                     a package) handle.

The following Distrib implementations are supported:
  tarball          For products that can be installed by simply un-tarring
                     a tar-ball file from the server; no compiling or other
                     "building" required.
  pacman           For Pacman distributions (see
                     http://atlas.bu.edu/~youssef/pacman/.
  builder          Products are built via a download-able Bourne scripts
                     with particular conventions.

The DefaultDistrib class provides is a partial implementation of the Distrib
abstract class that encodes certain assumptions about the location of
information on the distribution server, accessed via HTTP.  All of the
above concrete implementations use these assumptions and thus inherit from
DefaultDistrib.
