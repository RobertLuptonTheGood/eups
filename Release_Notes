2016-05-15 (rhl)
    - Added support for a new flag --external to setup{Optional,Required} in table files
    N.b. this is not visible from the setup command, but can be seen by passing
    listExternalDependencies=True to Table.dependencies()

2016-05-11 (rhl)
    - Added support for setupRequired(eups [> XXX]) to check eups version
    N.b. We implicitly add "-n", and no setup is performed.

2016-03-29 (rhl)
    - Added --debug none (which does nothing, but is convenient from cmdLine)

2016-03-22 mjuric (2.0.2)

    - Update code to support both python 2.6+ and 3.3+ (dropping 2.5 and older).
      Due to the complexity involved in accomplishing this, this release
      should be considered EXPERIMENTAL. Please let us know of any issues or
      bugs. (patchset contributed by Miguel de Val-Borro)
    - Ensure DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH survives setup/unsetup on OS X 10.11 El Capitan
    - Rework setups.c?sh scripts to use maximally re-use eups.table file

    bug fixes:
      - make eupspkg more robust on machines with >= ~24 cores
      - 'unsetup eups' didn't work under (t)csh
      - don't depend on cPickle-specific behavion
      - bin/eups_setup_impl.py.in: move imports so PYTHONPATH recovery works
      - configure.ac: unescape ${prefix} so it gets expanded
      - Makefile.in: create $EUPS_PATH after clearing $EUPS_DIR
      - on non-GNU systems options must come before arguments
      - cStringIO and io.StringIO are not interchangeable
      - fix unit tests broken by Python 3 compatibility code

2015-12-24 mjuric (1.5.10)
      jhoblitt: allow https:// URLs in EUPS_PKGROOT
      timj: Allow spaces in path names
      rhl: Use a python2 compatible version of commonpath to replace commonprefix
           The problem is paths such as "/foo/bar" and "/foo/bar_XXX" for which commonprefix returns "/foo/bar"
      rhl: Allow user to specify a product name with "eups tags --clone"

2015-05-06 mjuric (1.5.9)
      rhl: Added "eups tags glob" and made "eups tags" write tags on separate lines when writing to a pipe
      Python 2.4 compatibility fix

2015-03-30 mjuric (1.5.8)
      Various improvements and performance optimizations for stacks with
      tens of thousands of declared products.

2014-11-11 rhl (1.5.7)
      Multi-tasking failure on my part.  We stopped using a "v" prefix with 1.0.0
      Otherwise this is identical to v1.5.6 and 1.5.5

2014-11-11 rhl (v1.5.6)
      Tagged at Frossie's request

2014-11-11 rhl (1.5.5)
      ignore;  rhl didn't follow release process

2014-10-12 mjuric (v1.5.4)
      detect_compiler: set $CXX_CXX11_FLAG to the flag that enables C++11

2014-10-10 rhl (v1.5.3)
      Prevent setups.* overriding EUPS_DIR

      Make setups.sh posix compliant (e.g. ksh, zsh, dash)

2014-10-04 mjuric (v1.5.2)
      Support expanding environment variables when productDir is specified in a table file
      Avoid hang in pkgautoversion on OS X

2014-08-18 mjuric (v1.5.1)
      Add a script to correctly cut new EUPS releases (release-new-version.sh)

      Other feature additions and fixes (see git log for details)

2014-04-24 rhl
      Renamed "newest" tag to "latest".  Maybe it's just an Real English thing, but "newest" just
      sounds wrong.

2014-04-21 rhl
      Made a vro of "version!" (not version) in a setup{Optional,Required} statement ignore --keep
      (see change on 2014-04-02).


      Motivation:  it's useful to set an absolute version even when you want
      to keep already setup products.  The absolute path specification is also useful,
      so here's a way to support the latter.  E.g.
         setupRequired(hscPipe --vro version 2.10.0b_hsc)
         setupRequired(astrometry_net_data --vro version! sdss-dr8)

2014-04-21 rhl
      Ignore "-t newest" tags in ~/.eups unless that's the only version available

2014-04-21 rhl
      Make "eups unsetup" cleanup all eups shell variables

2014-04-21 rhl
      Support e.g. eups declare -t XXX -r DDD PROD VERSION

      In general, if we are changing a definition and also declaring a tag, generate
      a tag:XXX version with the changed attributes

2014-04-04 rhl
      Added unsetup{Required|Optional} to table files.

      An example is the LSST processing stack, where setup algorithms are run and a top-level
      product sets up a default set.  If want to disable some it's convenient to unsetup them up
      in your own product (using unsetupOptional(ALG -j))

2014-04-03 rhl
      Interpret -r DIR in a tableFile as $PRODUCT_DIR/DIR if DIR isn't an absolute path

2014-04-02 rhl
      Made a vro of "version" in a setup{Optional,Required} statement ignore --keep
      (but generate a warning unless --quiet)

      Motivation: when setting an absolute version in a table file irrespective of tags e.g.
           setupRequired(astrometry_net_data --vro version sdss-dr8)
      setting up --keep failed to setup sdss-dr8 if a version was already setup.

2014-03-31 rhl
      Always obey --keep while processing setup{Requested,Optional} statements (i.e. fixed
      bug where specifying tags disabled --keep)

2014-03-29 rhl
      Added command
      	    eups tags --clone OLD NEW
      to assign tag NEW to all products tagged OLD

      Added command
      	    eups tags --delete XXX
      to delete tag XXX from all tagged products

2014-03-07 mjuric (v1.3.0)
      Stabilized the eupspkg distribution mechanism and API. See eups.distrib.eupspkg
      module docstring for details

2014-02-26 rhl
       Stop "setup --keep --verbose" from printing the products that are being kept

       They are still printed at verbosity >= 2

2014-01-16 rhl
      Added etc/eups.el to syntax-colour table files in emacs

2014-01-16 rhl
      Remove eups_expandbuild eups_remove eups_uses (use e.g. "eups remove" instead)

2014-01-14 Fabrice Jammes
      Select python interpreter at configure time

2014-01-09 rhl
      Added "eups admin show" command (only "... show python" is currently implemented)

2014-01-01 mjuric
      Added new distribution type, eupspkg.  Supercedes build, and can be used to replace tarball too
      N.b.  pacman is deprecated and unsupported, as is the lsst-specific .bld system

2014-01-01 rhl
      Add ability to NOT reinstall a product even with eups distrib install --force

      This is done via an entry in manifest.remap:
      product[:version]  noReinstall
      and is useful if you have local declarations of e.g. python

2013-07-16 rhl
       Added "eups distrib path" and deprecated "eups pkgroot"

2013-02-13 rhl
       Support
           hooks.config.Eups.defaultTags = dict(pre=["XXX", "YYY"], post=["ZZZ"])
       in startup.py to specify that setup, with no tags, is equivalent to
           setup -t XXX,YYY -T ZZZ

       N.b. you can disable this with setup -t None (or setup -t "")

2013-02-08 rhl
       Permit environmental variables in setup{Optional,Required}.

       Allow ${XXX} (no ?) when referencing environmental variables; abort if XXX is not defined

2013-02-07 rhl
       Fix bug whereby you couldn't use other-users' tags referring to shared stacks

2013-01-09 rhl
       Committed support for --debug=profile (it was written I don't know when)

2012-09-13 rhl
       Support eups distrib list -v prod [version] to list dependencies of specified product

2012-06-27 rhl
       Added print command to table files.  The first word (which may be separated by a comma) may be one of
       stdout, stderr, stdok, stdinfo, stdwarn

2012-05-23 rhl
      Added --checkCycles to eups list to detect cycles in dependencies

2012-04-13 rhl
       Added --raw option to eups list to generate machine-parseable output

       Made it possible to use locks even when parts of EUPS_PATH are write protected

2012-04-04 pprice + rhl
       Some versions of readline emit junk to stdout when sourced (e.g. on os/x 10.7).  Workaround
       this bug

2012-02-27 rhl
       Add support for envUnset(PRODUCT_DIR) to disable setting e.g. GIT_DIR; other environment variables
       may not be unset (as unsetup can't easily set them again)

2012-02-16 rhl
       Added --noCallbacks option to disable calling user callbacks (as defined in e.g. startup.py)

2012-02-15 rhl
       *WARNING* Changed meaning of setup -T
       To specify a setup type use --type (e.g. --type build); -T is now used to specify a tag
       that goes after any version or versionExpr in the VRO.

       E.g.
          setup -t rhl -T beta
       means that rhl overrides any version specifications, and beta provides a backup if nothing
       else matches

2012-02-14 rhl
       Added eups list --name to only print product names (e.g. eups list -t rhl --name)

2012-01-23 rhl
       Handle LOCAL: versions in tags files (if the directory exists)

2012-01-23 rhl
       Add "white" and "black" colours, and an optional ";bold" suffix.

2012-01-06 rhl
       Set the version to LOCAL:... with setup -r XXX prod version

2011-12-19 rhl
       Make "eups remove -t rhl product" remove a tagged version, as opposed to
       "eups remove -t tag" which deletes a tag

       Make eups undeclare -t XXX remove the version as well as the tag if the only
       version name is of the form tag:XXX

2011-12-15 rhl
      Added support for storing arbitrary files in the ups_db (parallel to the method
      used to support -M filename); the directory is available as the environment variable
      $PRODUCT_DIR_EXTRA

      E.g.
            eups declare ... -L /u/rhl/foo.cfg:cfg -L bar:ups/aaa/mine.goo
      to create $PRODUCT_DIR_EXTRA/cfg/foo.cgf and $PRODUCT_DIR_EXTRA/ups/aaa/mine.goo

      N.b. the location of "-M" table files has (transparently) moved; they are now in
      	    $PRODUCT_DIR_EXTRA/ups/product.table

2011-12-08 rhl
      Switched name of default product from "toolchain" to "implicitProducts";
      the old name is still secretly supported

2011-12-07 rhl
      Add hooks.config.Eups.colorize to colour error messages (if your terminal supports it).
      The value can be a bool or a dict with keys taken from ["OK", "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR"] and values
      supported colours (e.g. "red")

2011-12-07 rhl
    Taught "eups admin info" to list manifest files

2011-12-07 rplante
    bug fix: eups.findProducts(): handle version/tag collision, added tests for vers. expr.

2011-11-14 cloomis
    add SunOS flavor

2011-11-11 price
    Cleanup of 'eups distrib create --rebuild' functionality.
    
    New callbacks are:
      hooks.config.Eups.repoVersioner: callable that receives a product name and version
    name and returns the "repository version" (i.e., version name before any rebuilds).
      hooks.config.Eups.versionIncrementer: callable that receives a product name and
    version name and returns the next "build version".
    
    The defaults for both of these implement "plus versions".
    
2011-11-07 rhl
    Make expressions work with eups list

2011-11-07 rhl
    Allow user to say "eups.Eups.allowRaise = True" in startup.py

2011-10-27 rhl
    Permit -r ~/foo in table files

2011-10-26 rhl
    Handle more than one tag in a table file entry; allow both tags and an explicit version

2011-10-26 rhl
    Support -r in setup{Optional,Required}

2011-10-26 rhl
    Handle setupRequired(-t productName) n.b. missing tag name

2011-10-21 price
    Fix product remapping during repository creation so that remapped products get identified
    with table files, flavor, and distId: introduced new method Distrib.updateDependencies()
    to do this.

2011-10-20 price
    Clean up handling of letter versions in expanding build files.

2011-10-20 rhl
    Handle e.g. hooks.config.distrib["builder"]["variables"]["SVNROOT"] in user's startup.py files

2011-10-20 rhl
    Retry taking exclusive lock in case a shared lock (e.g. a setup or expandtable) is still running

2011-10-19 rhl
    Detect 64 bit for os/x 10.7

2011-09-25 rhl
    Permit setup ... -m none

2011-09-25 rhl
    Local products need not have tables

2011-09-25 rhl
      Don't fail if you can't create the lock directory when you only need a shared lock

      Updated the bash_completion code

2011-09-20 rhl
      Add option hooks.config.site.lockDirectoryBase to control the existence or location of lock files;
      you are expected to set this in a site, not personal, startup.py directory

      If None, no locking is performed.  If a path, create lock directories relative to that location
      (e.g. "/tmp" means that you'll have lock directories such as "/tmp/u/lsst/products/.lockDir")

2011-09-14 rhl
      Complain (if verbose) and continue if unable to create a lock directory in the stack.

2011-09-12 rhl
      Make "setup -r . foo 1.2.4" use foo 1.2.4's table file for dependencies, but set PRODUCT_DIR to .

2011-09-07 rhl

      Redid locking so you can have multiple shared locks (e.g. setup), a single exclusive
      lock (e.g. eups declare), or no locking (--nolocks or e.g. eups path)

      N.b. This is done at the eups/setup level so there is no locking if you're running your own scripts
      using the eups api.  You can lock by saying something like:
      	    import lock
      	    locks = lock.takeLocks("myCmd", eups_path, lock.LOCK_SH, nolocks=False, verbose=0)
      eups will take care of the cleanup (or you can; lock.giveLocks(locks, verbose=0))

      Also added "eups admin listLocks"

2011-08-18 rhl
      Added support for [optional] ConfigParser files in ups dirs; if distrib.binary is present and True,
      don't bump letter version with distrib create --rebuild

2011-08-17 rhl
      Handle the case that we only have access to a "letter version" rather than the original
      svn/hg/... version

2011-08-17 rhl
      Optional products should be labelled optional in the exact block, even if we did find them when
      expanding the table

2011-08-15 rhl
      Generate warning upon attempting to undeclare other people's tags (the attempt still fails)

2011-08-14 rhl
      Don't include product foo when expanding foo.table

2011-07-06 price
      Only allow versions that are actually setup to be expanded. eups.getDependencies() was not necessarily
      using the correct (setup) version.

2011-06-24 rhl
	Expand @$VAR@ to ${VAR:-VALUE} (rather than @VAR@ -> VALUE) allowing them to be overridden by
	environment variables at runtime.

2011-06-22 rhl

	Added --rebuild and --rebuildSuffix options to eups distrib create to permit the generation
	of "letter versions", i.e. version with identical source code, but built against a changed ABI.

	Allow a prefix [create] in manifest.remap files to ignore (or remap) products when creating a
	distribution

	Allow a file template.build in one of the startup locations (i.e. places where startup.py can lurk)
	to be used to build any product without a build file.  It's not clear how useful this is, as you
	may still need a table file

	Allow e.g. 
	  hooks.config.distrib["builder"]["variables"]["SVNROOT"] = "svn://svn.lsstcorp.org"
	in a startup.py file (overriding the environment).  Any key in this dict is eligible for
	expansion (e.g. @HGROOT@).


2011-05-26 rhl
	Permit config.Eups.userTags of the form (["XXX", "YYY*"], "rhl") (i.e. a glob)

2011-05-05 rhl
	Make eups list show the ups_db that a tag appears in if it's declared in more than one

2011-05-03 rhl
	Added support for && (== and) in version expressions, e.g.
	    eigen >= 2.0.0 && < 3.0.0
	Not a full parser, so caveat emptor

2011-04-27 rhl
	Support eups -t file ...

2011-04-21 price
	Added first-cut script at bash command-line completion for eups and setup commands.

2011-04-17 rhl
	  1/ Call expandtable on installed tables
	  2/ Fix installation of server tags
	  3/ Make the first installation of any product current if no other tags are specified
	  4/ Declare dummy versions if requested by directives in manifest.remap

2011-04-16 rhl
	Support $?{PRODUCT_DIR} in table files

2011-04-14 rhl
	Ensure that only the first occurrence of a TAG.list file on the pkgroot path is used. N.b. as a
	feature, an empty early current.list file will render NCSA's invisible; maybe there should be a way to
	say, "and continue searching"

2011-04-14 rhl
	Don't set "current" from the server unless you specify -C

2011-04-14 rhl
	Support "eups distrib declare -t XXX" to declare all XXX tags

2011-04-12 rhl
	Added a product (defaultProduct in hooks.py) that is implicitly added to all
	table files. N.b. not used if there is no tablefile; this is a bug

2011-04-12 rhl
	Support multiple tags in eups list

2011-04-12 rhl
	Make failed servers on EUPS_PKGROOT a failure unless forced

2011-03-24 rhl
	Added eups list --topological to perform a topological sort

2011-03-22 rhl
        Added a -N (--nolock) option to setup, and arranged that registered callback functions are called
	twice (once with a null Eups object);  the first time is early enough to be used to disable locking

	Documented callback functions

2011-01-21 rhl
	Permitted
		setup -t XXX -r .
	to deduce the product (foo) from ups/foo.table and set the version to "none"
	N.b. the path is probably of the form .../foo so the normal "-r ." deduction would
	guess that the product was ... and the version foo;  this is correct for installed
	versions, but -t versions are often not installed

2010-12-30 rhl
	Fixed various aspects of the (type == "exact") processing

	Allow a user to specify that a tag is defined by some other user, e.g.
	hooks.config.Eups.userTags = [("beta", "rhl")]

2010-12-15 rhl
	Made expandtable set the exact versions in an if (type == "exact") block

	Allow more than one setupType (e.g. -T "build exact" or -T "build,exact").  Interpret
	      if (type == "exact")
	as
	      if ("exact" in type)

	Make -e equivalent to -T exact, and reinstate the behaviour that specifying an explicit version
	sets --exact (unless you say --inexact)

	Make setupType == exact remove user/global tags from the VRO (with the exception of tags explicitly
	set with e.g. -t XXX)

	The result of these changes is that you can setup the exact versions that a product was installed with,
	without any guesswork with
		setup foo x.y.z

2010-09-02 rhl

	Tags in startup.py are now all lists (allowing you to append without worrying about whitespace);
	watch out for python's nasty habit of treating a string as a list of characters...

	Added ability to specify a file as a tag (-t FILENAME) which contains a set of "product version" pairs;
	"setupRequired(product version)" is also permitted.  The file may be explicitly indicated as
	-t file:FILENAME in case "file" is also a valid tagname (which takes priority)

	Automatically added a tag to the start of the VRO if no VRO is explicitly specified for that tag

	Fixed --keep; it now works by adding "keep" to the VRO

	Added ~/.eups/manifest.remap to allow the user to override/delete versions in a distribution, e.g.
	doxygen:1.5.9  			1.6.3
	python:Any			2.6.1
	tcltk				None

        Many changes (I should look them up and document them.)

2009-10-12 gk
	Changed the Makefile in doc so that the install never fails for documentation errors.
	ticket https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/325

2009-10-11 rhl
	Fixed
		eups declare -c prod version
	for NULL (in general fallback flavors) products; ticket https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/354

2009-10-06  rhl

	Fix some HeadURL issues so eups version works (setup version already did)

2009-10-05  rhl

	Added warnings for ignored options in table file setups, and warn
	that -e is implied when you specify a version to setup

2009-09-26  rhl

	Search fallback flavors for a current version in eups list

2009-09-24  rhl

	Allow a table file to have no actions if setup didn't specify
	e.g. -T build

2009-09-17  rhl

	Only read the desired flavor from a cache; make clearCache clear
	all fallback caches too
	
	allow "eups list -D -c product"

2009-09-16  rhl

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Here are the old Release Notes:


v0_7_17: New features:
	   - Added GNU configure support. (RHL)
	   - Added support for colon-delimited $EUPS_PATHs (CPL)

v0_7_14: Changes to evilinstall in an attempt to support more SDSS products

v0_7_13: Trivial bug fix

v0_7_12: Added version information to -h option; added export commands 
	 to setups.sh

v0_7_4: Trivial bugfix

v0_7_2: Verbosity levels adjusted

v0_7_1: Minor bugfix in extract_table_commands()

v0_7: Continuation of the Great Cleanup
	-- Proper help is now added into the code

	-- Complete rewrite of the extract_table_commands();
	   Now includes support for table files that have a common
	   commands section before the flavor specifications.


v0_6: First tag after the Great Cleanup.

	-- More work on new minimalistic table files; bugs fixed

	-- Significant cleanup/factoring of code

	-- New argument parser in eups_setup

	-- Reduced chatter if $debug == 1 (but can set -v -v to set it to 2)

	-- Indented "Setting up" lines (with -v) to indicate depth of dependency nesting



v0_5: A branch; the first version on this branch (v5_0_0) is identical to v0_4

At this point, the code was enhanced:

	-- EUPS now includes support for minimal table files, or, indeed,
	no table file at all ("-m none")

	-- setupenv and proddir are now deprecated. The appropriate environment
	variables are automatically set.

	-- Removed hardcoded file sizes from eups_setup.pm

	-- Added checks that ensure that the Table files are properly formed.


v0_4 :
	-- evilinstall now uses eups_expandtable

	-- Created eups_expandtable to expand table files

	-- Evilinstall now no longer calls sdssmake with the -idl flag.

	-- The toplevel Makefile now copies over the GPL license and the 
	   Release_Notes


v0_3 : 
    
	-- The Makefile now creates the $(PRODUCTS) (where the database is)
	  and $(PROD_DIR_PREFIX) (where the products are) directories.


v0_2 :  Tagged Saturday, April 5,2003 0130

        -- Fixed bug with setup - now correctly unsets previous setups.
 
        -- -z now propagates the database to all dependencies.

        -- Shifted the perl location to /usr/bin/perl from /usr/local/bin/perl
 
        -- Added the GNU General Public License (gpl.txt).

	-- Table files are now forced to be in the ups/ subdirectory of the 
	product directory, and have to have the name $PRODUCT.table. The -m
	option is still accepted by setup, but is overriden, as is any 
	information about table files in the version files.

	-- eups_declare changed to reflect the changes brought about by
	the above change.

	-- The Makefile has been changed to be Solaris compliant.

	-- Fixed a bug with pathPrepend in the table file reader.

	-- Fixed a bug with command line argument passing in eups_setup

v0_1 : First released version
